      <h1>Welcome to Feez Ka Dojo aka FKD</h1>
      <div className="about-content">
        <p>Initially, Feez Ka Dojo was a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu academy based in Karachi, Pakistan and was led by me Abdul Hafeez Siddiqui. However, in 2021 I decided to move to Sweden for my Masterâ€™s degree and to get some good quality training to improve my BJJ. I eventually started training at the Lund Grappling Academy under Alex Musi and since then I have been travelling around different cities in Sweden and different Countries in Europe to train Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. Currently, I am based in Gothenburg, Sweden and I train with the Conde BJJ team under Head Coach Martin Hedenbergh.</p>
        <p>As my passion for BJJ keeps growing, I am excited to start my own FKD branded Gi's/Kimonos, Rash Guards, and other fight wear products. My objective is to provide the best quality Gi's and Rash Guards to the BJJ and MMA community with excellent customer service. All I ask is your trust in me, and I assure you I won't let you down.
